# Au(to)did(act)

This is my object-oriented implementation of the Lox language from Crafting Interpreters. I chose C# because I reasoned it was the closest non-JVM language to Java out there.

Not sure whether it's a faux pas to give your Lox implementation a completely different name, but since I'm telling you what it is, it's fine.
